A generic collection implementation, that can store any number of elements, of any kind and size.
You can mix different types objects in the collection.
When you push an object in the collection, this object is not actually copied in.
Only a reference is added to the collection.
This means that if you change the object after you push it into the collection,
the object in the collection also changes.
